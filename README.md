building basic twitter using Spring boot

This Web App allows people to follow/mock and unfollow users and shows users the hashtags that other people are using. 

Users can also see what friends/coworkers have posted 


This project was challenging because I had a week to get this done and without knowing all the components to build this Twitter Web App. 
I had quite a bit of trial and error as i was completing this project. Learning Spring Security, Validation, and Authorization on the fly 
was very intriguing at the least. Utilizing different dependicies, understandign the correct imports, and learning from the exception throw 
to where in my project the code has broken has been my greatest feat working on this Twitter app.
