# mockingbirdproject
building basic twitter using Spring boot

Start Mocking/Twitting here: https://twittercopyapp.herokuapp.com/

This Web App allows people to follow/mock and unfollow users and shows users the hashtags that are trending on the feed. 
Instead of Twitter I called it Mock because I am mocking twitter. Do you get it? Mockingbird? I am Mocking/Macking a better Twitter. 

Users can also see what friends/coworkers have posted on the Twit Feed. 


This project was challenging because I had a week to get this done and without knowing all the components to build this Twitter Web App. 
I had quite a bit of trial and error as i was completing this project. Learning Spring Security, Validation, and Authorization on the fly 
was very intriguing at the least. Utilizing different dependicies, understandign the correct imports, and learning from the exception throw 
to where in my project the code has broken has been my greatest feat working on this Twitter app.
